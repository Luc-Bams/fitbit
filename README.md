# My fitbit data
This repository contains scripts to collect that data from the fitbit API and a notebook containing my analysis of this data.

## Objectives
* Find out how my feeling of getting fitter over time reflects in the data. [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">notebook</span>](https://luc-bams.github.io/fitbit/getting_fitter.html)
* Use my historical heart rate data to determine custom heart rate zones.
* Find out how fitbit calculates Cardio Fitness.
* Create some estimates for when I will receive new badges.
* Have fun exploring my own heart rate data and hope I don't find anything alarming.
